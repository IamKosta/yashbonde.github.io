        <h1>Freeciv vs. StarCraft II</h1>
        <h2>Notes on DeepMind AlphaStar</h2>

        <time datetime="30-01-2019">JAN. 08, 2019</time>

        <p>
            DeepMind has been continuously shocking the world since its original <a class="article-a" href="">DQN Paper</a> back in 2014. I wasn't really inspired by its achievement, truth be told I was too naive to understand the importance of the project. Then <a class="article-a" href="">AlphaGo</a> and it's smarter brother <a class="article-a" href="">AlphaZero</a> showed extremely high problem solving skills, though is it really intelligent can be doubted. AlphaZero was not only good at Go but also at other board games such as  <a class="article-a" href="">Chess</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2016 they joined hands with Blizzard Entertainment, a video game developer with much loved titles such as <a class="article-a" href="">StarCraft II</a>, to create a learning environment for the same. This <a class="article-a" href="">pysc2</a> was supposed to be a massive succes, but was relatively un-used, one reason might be the huge size of SCII that needs to be installed on the system. The lack of activity on their repo and huge size was the real reason I started the <a class="article-a" href="">freeciv-python</a> project. Nonetheless, they are finally here and they are here for good. With <a class="article-a" href="">AlphaStar</a> another jewel has been added to their ever growing crown.

        <h3>what it is and how it works</h3>

        <p>
            For begginers AlphaStar is a neural network driven AI to play Starcraft 2, and in current demonstration is only trained to play very well as <a class="article-a" href="">protos civ</a> which is why the initial demonstration against TLO was rejected by many people as TLO being another civ player. Eventually in another set of <a class="article-a" href="">match</a> against MaNa showed that it was indeed one of the best SC2 players out there.
