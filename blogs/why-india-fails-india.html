    	<h1>Why India Fails India</h1>
    	<h2>And it will continue to do so (not just another rant on education system)</h2>

    	<p>
    		I wanted to write this as a very long piece on Medium but felt like I should push it here before publishing it somewhere else. This writing has been has been long overdue and it's very interesting to write about it because of the diversity of it. The world is very complex and it needs to be broken down to simpler form for people to understand. It's very difficult to explain why so many things that we often find stupid (like X) exist, but their is often a reason for it (like reason for X). This is where modern society and it's need for instant gratification comes in, looking for reason is often very boring and time consuming and frankly not very intersting.

            The repurcussions are what we are facing today, I don't want to use the word "fake news" let's just call it "partial news". By partial I mean several things namely biased or incomplete. These are the kind of information channels that are designed to grab your attention by giving out partial news. We need to think of them as tools, they can be used for good (headlines) and bad (fake news). This partial information results improper decisions and bad opinions, and bad opinions in masses are a very bad thing (read elections).
        </p>

        <p>
            I want to discuss another such thing today, the Education System in India, and why I think this is such a disaster and how I think we can fix this. Discussion about education system is another victim of partial information, people with incomplete information and <b>poorly thought out understanding</b> keep commenting on it and reinforcing the loop. Changing such a massive entity is not an overnight thing and doing things like <a class="article-a" href="http://www.uniindia.com/news/india/my-govt-set-up-seven-new-iits-seven-iims-103-kendriya-vidyalayas-in-four-years-pm-modi/1451698.html">increasing number of insitutes</a> is nothing but a temporary but <a class="article-a" href="http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/dec/03/36-faculty-positions-in-eight-iits-remain-vacant-1906441.html">poor fix</a> as it still struggles to get along.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to me the education system doesn't start at MHRD and end at faculties, but it encompasses the complete society as whole. Homo Sapiens are a unique species such that each new born is so special that in order to fully function it needs to be raised in a proper environment for over tten years before it starts being productive, in no other species do we see this long learning period. And so it makes sense that the complete society be responsible for proper education. I consider that there are four parts of education system:
            <li>Schooling (education tilll 18 years of age)</li>
            <li>University/College (education till getting job)</li>
            <li>University Faculty</li>
            <li>Beaurocrats and other policy makers</li>
        </p>

        <p>
            I will go over each one of those and show why they are inherently going to fail even if they are not designed to. And yes you students out there reading this, you are also part of the problem, though only a small and easily fixable one. I am using <a class="article-a" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZRDUZuIKg4&t=439s">first principle's ananlysis</a> to get to the bottom of this. The method is really simple, you take what are the few fundamental truths on ground, then see what the outcome is. The difference is where the issues are. Another major argument I want to raise here is the use of incentives, humans will take actions that they believe will be most beneficial to them (either in short term or long term). Finding differences is one thing, but to correct them we need to use proper incentives.
        </p>

        <p>
            So let's go over each one of the parts of the system and figure out what is happening here, why is it happening, what are the differences with what should be happening, why are those differences happening and what can be done to fix them.
        </p>

        <h3>Schools</h3>

        <p>
           When I was in middle school I had a very strong inclination towards physics, someone gave me their valuable first edition <a class="article-a" href="https://www.amazon.in/Feynman-Lectures-Physics-Vol-Bundle/dp/9332580952/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1546235248&sr=1-6&keywords=feynman+lectures+of+physics">Feynman's Lectures on Physics</a> Book 3, and I was totally blown away by it. Though I was no genius by any metric and could barely understand the mathematics in the book, the concepts of quantum mechanics were broken down to the level that a 13 year old could understand them. School teachers were finding it hard to grapple with the concept of angular momentum themselves while some teacher called <a class="article-a" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> could explain that so easily in a book written about 50 years ago. I really wanted to pursue physics but I knew I wasn't smart enough and unlike many poeple in this country I really wanted to pursue engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
           But something really weird happens if you are a high schooler in India, when you enter 11th grade you are told that you have to crack this very difficult exam called the JEE-Adavanced (prev. IIT-JEE) at the end of 12th grade and then you get into these so-called heavens of India, the Indian Institute of Technology. No sarcasm here, the guys who crack them are real though nuts, hats off! So most of the high school students are pushed into studying sciences, Physics-Chemistry-Mathematics/Biology (PCM/B) even if they want to study it or not. And ironically it's a favourite past time among students to laugh at how they were forced to study those subjects, despite them being victims of it. The student now gives up everything to study for this exam. For about two years many students just study relentlessly to prepare for this.
        </p>

        <p>
           Now this is not just my story, this is a story of millions of Indian school students. And there is a lot of debate whether this is good or bad, with people often accepting that this is bad but doesn't neccesarily affect the lives of people later in life. Well I differ with people here, what is happening here very fundamentally changes the society in long run. One main thing that kids in India lose in Schools is ability to ask questions, because sub par teachers cannot answer those questions and stop the kids from asking them. By systemically killing the curiosity among kids teachers are expecting them to stop asking question. But that is not the task of teacher, rather it is to enable questions and try to find solutions for those problems.
        </p>

        <p>
           What you are seeing here a poor upbringing of students right from KG, I cannot bring up incentives here, this is just poor quality of teaching and lack of discipline and self respect in the people who are supposed to be teaching tomorrow's generation. But luckily it's in our biology to be curious and we continue to maintain this curiosity.
        </p>

        <p>
           The solution here is very simple, expose the kids to the world and continuous and rigorous experimentation. Exposing kids not only to the technology world but also to the cultural and social systems. The best of determining what you like is by doing it, would you be happy if you learned that you like music and not coding at age of 45 when it is too late or 18? <b>Competition is a huge problem in a country of 1.3 billion people</b> and running away from it is not the solution, neither is direct exposure to it. Gradual and incremental competition exposure by setting up and promoting students to compete in small local events. This is not only helpful to the psyche of kid but this also allows for colaboration and boost the mental health by making them more confident. Hiding them from competition is not the correct way neither is pushing them directly onto the stage.
        </p>

        <h3>Universities</h3>

        <p>
           This section may be particularly long becuase this is what I am, I am a final year under graduate from <a class="article-a" href="http://nitrr.ac.in">NIT Raipur</a> and the idea for this article came when I was discussing with my friend, what is the most fundamental reason our college fails to create graduates of graet caliber. I know this may even sound borderline narcissist and a-hole for critisising my own institute. But if not us then who will critique our college, we know inside and out about how it works.
        </p>

        <p>
           Coming back to the point, by modern standards the word university means "a high-level educational institution in which students study for degrees and academic research is done." I will bring the academic research point later but let's look at the first half that is <b>students study for degrees</b>. Though correct no only is this is a really bad way of looking at it but from the perspective of student this is just unfair. Universities are supposed to be places where they are trained in the basics of a course, if it's engineering then basics of your stream. If you are studying medicine then study the complete human body, then specialise in any particular portion, you get the idea. And yes the courses are structured this way, but the execution is completely wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
           Students come in expecting what they will learn can help them change the world, which is not only very difficult but statistically near impossible. What they fail to understand is that all the courses boring or interesting, easy or difficult are important.
