            Hi! I am Yash Bonde and you seem to have landed on my website. I am an AI engineer at <a class="article-a" href="https://shipmnts.com/">Shipmnts</a> <a class="article-a" href="http://www.alex.shipmnts.com/">Alex</a>. I completed me undergraduate from NIT Raipur, India in B.Tech. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering. My main area of work is in developing better Artificial Intelligence Tools to augment human work and creativity. Thus inroder to work on the same I am focused on Reinforcement Learning in general and simulators specifically.
        </p>

        <p>
            Other than that I freelance as a graphics artist working in variety of products such as posters, logo work, UI/UX and I belive websites are the modern twist to art. Which is why I made this, to teach myself how to do that. It also doubles up as my online portfolio to showcase my skills and talent.
        </p>

        <p>
            I attempted building the world's most advanced reinforcement learning environment, <a class="article-a" href="blogs/fcle.html">FCLE</a> (FreeCiv Learning Environment). A game of chess has ~10<sup style="font-size: 13px;">120</sup> possible games, Go has ~10<sup style="font-size: 13px;">761</sup> possible games. A freeciv game can have ~10<sup style="font-size: 13px;">15000</sup> possible games and more because the game is opensource and new rulesets can be added to it anytime. Below is the artwork I did for the same it will be improved as it develops further.
